      <strong>5. Third-party links</strong>
      <div>This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or

        website, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website that you visit.
      </div>
      <strong>6. The data we collect about you</strong>
      <div>Personal data, or personal information means any information about an individual from which that person can
        be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
      </div>
      <div>We collect personal information which you provide directly to us, such as when you register for a TG.Casino
        Account or when you contact customer services. We also collect information from publicly available sources or
        third parties such as social media platforms and data aggregators.
      </div>
      <div>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped
        together as follows:
      </div>
      <div><strong>Identity Data</strong> includes first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier,
        marital status, title, date of birth and gender.

      <div><strong>Photographs</strong> include passports and other photographic identification that are collected to
        verify your identity.
      </div>
      <div><strong>Contact Data</strong> includes a billing address, home address (if different to billing address),
        email address and telephone numbers.
      </div>
      <div><strong>Financial Data</strong> includes bank account and payment card details.</div>

        the percentage of our customers accessing a specific feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data
        with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as

      <div>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you (for
        example, where it is required under our Player Terms and Conditions), and you fail to provide that data when
        requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example,
        to provide you with the ability to place bets or wagers). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or
        service that you may be attempting to access, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
      </div>

      <strong><span>12. &nbsp;Data security</span></strong>
      <p><span>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</span>
      </p>
      <p><span>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</span>
      </p><strong><span>13. &nbsp;Data retention</span></strong>

      </p>
      <p><span>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process the personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</span>

      </p><strong><span>14. &nbsp;Your rights</span></strong>
      <p><span>Under certain circumstances, you may have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:</span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>Request access</span><span>&nbsp;to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</span>
        </li>
        <li><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>Request correction</span><span>&nbsp;of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data that you provide to us.</span>
        </li>
        <li><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>Request erasure</span><span>&nbsp;of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal or regulatory reasons which will be notified to you.</span>
        </li>
        <li><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>Object to processing</span><span>&nbsp;of your personal data where there is something about a your particular situation which makes you want to object to our processing as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</span>
        </li>
        <li><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>Request restriction of processing</span><span>&nbsp;of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span>○ &nbsp; &nbsp; If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</span></p>
      <p><span>○ &nbsp; &nbsp; Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</span></p>
      <p><span>○ &nbsp; &nbsp; Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</span>
      </p>
      <p><span>○ &nbsp; &nbsp; You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>Request the transfer of your personal data</span><span>&nbsp;to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party they have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, you should contact us, and we will confirm whether we are able to do so. </span>
      </p>
      <p><span>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. </span>
      </p>
      <p><span>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</span>
      </p>
